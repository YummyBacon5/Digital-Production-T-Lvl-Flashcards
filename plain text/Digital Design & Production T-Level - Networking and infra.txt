Class A	This class of addresses are used for networks with a large number of total hosts
This class of addresses are used for networks with a large number of total hosts	Class A
Class B	This type of address class is used for medium to large sized networks
This type of address class is used for medium to large sized networks	Class B
Class C	This type of adress class is for small local area networks (LANs)
This type of adress class is for small local area networks (LANs)	Class C
Class D	"These types of addresses are used for ""multicasting""<br><br>Multicasting allows a single host to send a single stream of data to thousands of hosts across the&nbsp;Internet at the same time. It is often used for audio and video streaming, such as IP-based cable TV&nbsp;networks"

"Application layer protocol for transferring files over a TCP network. Allows browsing, uploading and downloading files. Authenticates using usernames and passwords.

"	
"Hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services and other resources on the internet. Translates human-readable domain names to IP addresses.

"	
"Network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network. Enables dynamic addressing and network configuration.

"	
"Internet protocol that allows email clients to access and manipulate messages stored on a server. Allows organizing emails into folders. Keep messages synchronized across devices.

"	
"Protocol for receiving emails from a remote server. Downloads entire messages to a local client. Deleted from server after downloading. Good for intermittent connections.

"	
"Application layer protocol for sending email messages between servers. Uses TCP connections to transfer email data in plaintext.

"	
"Application layer protocol for interactive text-based sessions over a network. Provides bidirectional communication for terminal emulation. No encryption, so considered insecure.

"	
"Protocol for monitoring and managing network devices like routers, switches, printers etc. Uses UDP for agent-to-manager communications.

"	
"Application layer protocol used for client-server communication on the web. Clients make requests, servers respond with resources. Uses TCP as the transport protocol.

What does the <b>application</b> <b>layer</b> do in the OSI model	It is the actual software used by humans such as:<br><ul><li>Discord</li><li>Google Chrome/Opera (Web browsers)</li><li>Outlook/Thunderbird (Email clients)</li><li>Spotify desktop (any internet connected apps)</li></ul>
What does the <b>presentation</b> <b>layer</b> do in the OSI model	It prepares data for the application layer to read and session layer to transmit by:<br><ul><li>Compressing/decompressing data</li><li>Encrypting/decrypting data</li></ul><div>SSL (which encrypts data between webserver and browser) is an example of a presentation layer protocol.</div>
What does the&nbsp;<b>session</b>&nbsp;<b>layer</b>&nbsp;do in the OSI model	The session layer creates, maintains and ends connections.<br><br>E.g. when joining a minecraft server, the session layer contacts the server informing it you wish to join, ensures it is maintained while connected and closes it when you disconnect from the server
What does the&nbsp;<b>transport</b>&nbsp;<b>layer</b>&nbsp;do in the OSI model	"<ul><li>The transport layer acts as the link between the ""Host Layers"" and ""Media Layers"".</li><li>The transport layer splits data to be sent into packets and reassembles packets that a recived</li></ul>&nbsp;TCP and UDP are Transport layer protocols<br><br>"
What does the&nbsp;<b>network</b>&nbsp;<b>layer</b>&nbsp;do in the OSI model	<ul><li>Responsible for deciding the route each packet will take from source to destination (routing)</li><li>Attaches a header to each packet containing: destination IP, total size and a count of how many networks the packet has traveled through</li></ul><div>The IP (Internet protocol) is one</div>
What does the&nbsp;<b>data link</b>&nbsp;<b>layer</b>&nbsp;do in the OSI model	<ul><li>Handles communication between two nodes, for your home computer this would be between your computer and network hub/router.</li><li>When sending: It prepares the packets for the 1st layer ready for the pysical hardware by encapsulating packets into frames</li><li>When receiving: It strips the packets back out of thease frames passing them to the 3rd layer</li><li>Attaches the source and destination MAC address (unique device identifier that doesn't change).</li><li>Notifies other layers if transmit or receive errors</li></ul>
What does the <b>physical</b>&nbsp;<b>layer</b>&nbsp;do in the OSI model	<ul><li>Transports the data electrically over cabes; optically over fibre optic or through electro-magnetc radiation as radio waves&nbsp;</li></ul>
What is <b>data framing</b> on the Data Link Layer?	<div><div>Encapsulating packets into frames with three sections</div><div><br></div><div>Header:</div><ul><li>The source and destination MAC address</li><li>Error checking checksum for the payload</li></ul><div><br></div></div><div>Payload:</div><div><ul><li>The actual data to be sent (from upper OSI layers)</li></ul><div>Trailer:</div></div><div><ul><li>Holds another checksum for the actual frame ensuring it is not changed in transit</li></ul></div>
